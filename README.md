# README

In this repository you will find data from a test rig experiment performed at the Laboratory of Acoustic and Vibration of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.

The matlab code _Main_experiment_Ritto.m_ loads data from _175_completo.mat_ and plots the time signal for (i) the angular speed, (ii) the torque-on-bit. and (iii) the weight-on-bit. It also shows the hysteresis loop for (a) torque-on-bit vs. angular speed and (b) weight-on-bit vs. angular speed.  

Note: we were not able to measure the axial speed of the bit, hence depth of cut is unknown.
